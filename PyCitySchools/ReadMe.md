*The main objective of the PyCitySchools homework assignment is to develop pandas scripts to analyze the schools and students datasets, given 2 raw data files in csv format; 'school_complete.csv' and 'students_complete.csv'.  The schools data is describe with a unique school ID, 14 school_name categorized as either district or charter types; and columns for the school size and their budgets.  With columns of data from student IDs, student_name, gender, grade, school_name, reading_score and math_score; the students data can be merged with the schools data by the school_name field.  Althouth, the 2 datasets were imerged and was initally used to calculate the total_schools by using the len(unique) function, but the dataset was ultimately not necessary as it was easier to separately use the schools and students datasets to calculate require metrics/data series ie. count of school_name for total_schools metric.

*Various metrics are calculated to produce different summary datasets for analysis; such as district summary dataframe where the total view of overall district school and student  metrics are presented.  This include 'Total Schools', 'Total Students', 'Total Budget', 'Average Math Score', 'Average Reading Score', 'Percentage of Passing Math', 'Percentage of Passing Reading' and the 'Percentage of Overall Passing'.  A view of district summary: [raw datasets](Images/district_summary.png).  Next, is a drill down of the same metrics for each school is summarized.
